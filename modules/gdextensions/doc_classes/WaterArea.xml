		Defines an area in which a [HydroRigidBody] will be affected by buoyancy and related forces.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		The purpose of the WaterArea node is threefold.  First, it limits the area in which a [HydroRigidBody] is evaluated for potential buoyancy. This means that if you only need water in a small area of your scene, the [HydroRigidBody] will not incur a performance penalty while it is outside the bounds of the WaterArea.
		The second purpose of the WaterArea is to define the surface of the water.  For a flat body of water, set the water_height parameter to the global-space height of the water. For a body of water with waves or any other advanced scenarios, attach a script to the WaterArea and define a _get_water_heights(positions) function.  The positions parameter is a PoolVector3Array.  For each Vector3 in the array, adjust its Y value to the height of the water at the given X and Z position.  The return value of the function should be the PoolVector3Array with the Y-values changed.  When this function is defined, the water_height parameter is ignored.
		Finally, the WaterArea acts as a standard [Area] node.  It can be used to trigger sound or particle effects to make an object splash when it hits the water.

		<member name="density" type="float" setter="set_density" getter="get_density">
			Sets the density of the water in this area.  Freshwater is 1000 kg/m^3, and seawater ranges from 1020 - 1029 kg/m^3.
		</member>
		<member name="flow_direction" type="Vector3" setter="set_flow_direction" getter="get_flow_direction">
			Creates a uniform current running through the area in the specified direction.  Any object submerged in this area will be pushed in the direction of the current.
		</member>
		<member name="viscosity" type="float" setter="set_viscosity" getter="get_viscosity">
			Adjusts the viscosity of the water in this area.  This value changes the resistance to motion through the fluid without affecting buoyancy.  The default value of 1.0 is a good starting point for water; for thicker substances such as maple syrup or lava try increasing the value.
		</member>
		<member name="water_height" type="float" setter="set_water_height" getter="get_water_height">
			Sets a constant global-space water height.  This value is not used if you create a custom wave height function instead.
