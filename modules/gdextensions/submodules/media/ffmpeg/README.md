### Godot Engine FFmpeg module

Godot Engine native module registering _GDNative Video Decoders_ using the FFmpeg library for codecs (mostly based based on https://github.com/kidrigger/godot-videodecoder).

_FFmpeg_ static libraries are coming from https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp-ffmpeg (_ppsspp_ is using old API, so I had to update the code a bit).
