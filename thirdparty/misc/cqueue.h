cqueue
======

cqueue is a C library that provides persistent, named data queues for
programs. Arbitrarily many queues can co-exist, given they have distinct
names.

Arbitrary binary data can be stored. Queues are manipulated using a
stack-based API:

* <code>push()</code> -- append data to the queue
* <code>pop()</code> -- pop data from the queue
* <code>peek()</code> -- retrieve data from a given stack index


originally, I port libqueue from another github developer projects to use leveldb, but I found
that queue_pop was extremely slow. I actually don't need or want the level's  or key value aspects
of level db so I wrote this as simple file based replacement.

Back ground
============
I needed a simple durable fast queuing solution for one of my projects. I found a simple durable queue api at https://github.com/2ion/libqueue which was using Tokyo Cabinet for storage of which I didn't like the licensing. I ported it to use leveldb and found the performance for deleting (popping) records was extremely slow:
[:~/libqueue] master+* ± ./bench
it took 0 to push 10485760(inf) in 1024(inf) blocks
it took 36 to pop 10485760(291271) in 1024(28.4444) blocks
https://github.com/acgreek/libqueue
so replaced leveldb with a simpl file based back-end

[:~/cqueue] master(+1/-1)* ± ./bench
it took 0 to push 104857600(inf) in 1024(inf) blocks
it took 1 to pop 104857600(1.04858e+08) in 1024(1024) blocks
https://github.com/acgreek/cqueue
note: I ran these tests on my hp chromebook running cruton linux



API Overview
============

```C
/*
  Intransparent data type. Nothing to see here...
*/
Queue;

/*
  Data structure used to store data in, and retrieve data from the
  queue
*/
QueueData {
  void *v;
  size_t vlen;
};

/*
  Functions return LIBQUEUE_SUCCESS on success, LIBQUEUE_FAILURE on
  error or LIBQUEUE_MEM_ERROR as a special failure type for failed
  memory allocations.
*/

/*
  Open a named queue. Directory location is provided as string
  <id>. Queues are persistent and data stored previously will still be
  available through the name it was written to. Operations on a queue
  must conclude with a call to queue_close().
  This function ensures that ${path}/libqueue exist. If it doesn't
  and cannot be created OR not written to, this function fails.
*/
Queue *  queue_open(const char *path);


/*
  Same as queue_open but allow one to provde options for various settings
  The vararg must be terminated by a NULL to indicate end of options

  options are to be provided as strings with some requiring args

  available options:
	maxBinLogSize     byte size of the binlog, smaller binlogs cost performance in that as the queue grows and strinks, the more files will be created and destroyed. Larger binlog will use up more disk space for when the entries are deleted
	maxEntries        Max number of entries in the queue. queue_push will return LIBQUEUE_FAILURE if attempt is made to exceed this limit
	maxSizeInByte     Max number of appropriate disk usage of queue. queue_push will return LIBQUEUE_FAILURE if attempt is made to exceed this limit

 */
Queue *  queue_open_with_options(const char *path,..., NULL);


/*
  Push a data object onto the queue. QueueData must be filled
  appropriately: d->v is a void* pointer to the data, d->vlen holds the
  data size.

*/
int queue_push(Queue *q, QueueData *d);

/*
  Pop data from the queue. The library will store the data in the passed
  QueueData struct. d->v must be freed by the user.
*/
int queue_pop(Queue *q, QueueData *d);

/*
  returns total size of all files used by the queue unless there are zero elements
  in which it will return 0

*/
int queue_len(Queue *q, int64_t *len);

/*
  returns numbers of elements in the queue
*/
int queue_count(Queue *q, int64_t *countp);

/*
  compacts the queue on file system to use take up less disk space if possible
*/
int queue_compact(Queue *q);
/*
  Like queue_pop(), but doesn't remove the data object from the queue
  and returns the data at queue position s. Indexing is not used
*/
int queue_peek(Queue *q, int64_t s, QueueData *d);

/*
   Like queue_push(), but over-writes the data at queue position s. This
   function cannot be used to append new data to the queue. Indexing
   starts from zero. s must be positive.
 */
int queue_poke(Queue *q, int64_t s, QueueData *d);


/*
  Closes the queue. Only AFTER this function has been called one can be
  sure that the data has been properly stored. Undefined behaviour may
  occur if the concluding call to this function is omitted.
*/
int queue_close(Queue *q);
```

<code>Queue</code> is an opaque data type the fields of which
should not be accessed directly.

Building
========

Dependencies:
none

libqueue uses cmake for building:

cmake .
make

Usage
=====

It's very simple: Use

```C
#include <queue.h>
```

in your C program and link it with

```sh
-lqueue
```
given that libqueue was installed into the default linker search path.

queueutils
==========

The library comes with a number of reference/test/practical utilities
that all operate on the queue named 'queueutils-stack0' to be used on
the command line:

qpush
-----

Pushes all its arguments in onto the queue
</code>queueutils-stack0</code>. Exits with an error code of 0 if the
push was successful and 1 if it wasn't.

qpop
----

Pops the strings from the queue that were pushed using
<code>qpush</code>, on element per call to qpush. If there is no element
to pop, exits with the status code 1. If the pop was successfu, it
prints the string to stdout and exists with the status code 0.

qlen
----

if there are no entries, then zero is returned or else the total size of all file used by the queue is returned

qcount
----
number of elments in the queue


qcompact
----
not used

qrepair
----
not implemented


qpeek
-----

Peek at elements in the queueutils' queue.
```sh
qpeek <INDEX> [<index1>[..<indexN>]]</indexN>]]
```
Tries to peek at all indizes listed as arguments. Skips over invalid indizes but fails if the queue cannot be accessed properly.

qpoke
-----

Replace an existing in the queue with another one.

qpoke <INDEX> <NEW VALUE>
Fails if we cannot poke the element at the specified index, or if the index is out of bounds.

</NEW></INDEX>

qtest
-----
executes some basic tests
