/* sr_graph - v1.2 - public domain plot tracer; no warranties implied, use at your own risk.
 
 Usage:
	 All colors are defined by their red, green, blue components
	 taking values in [0.0,1.0].
	 Start by creating a graph using:
 
		 setup(min x, max x, min y, max y, ratio, margins, red, green, blue);

		        +----+(1,1)
		        |    |
		        |    |
		 (-1,-1)+----+

	 You specify the bounds of the graph (minimal and maximal values on both 
	 axes), the screen ratio, the margins for all sides (between 0 - no margin - and 1 - no
	 graph -; left+right and bottom+top margins need to be < 2), and the  background color.
	 This will return an integer ID that you will use as a reference to the graph for later calls.
 
	 The graph can be customized by adding axes with arrows (automatically 
	 oriented  toward the increasing values on both axes). You can specify their
	 width (in [0,1]) and set their color. By default the axes will pass through
	 the (0,0) point or stick to the sides of the graph the closest to it. You 
	 can also force them to stick on the side by setting 'side axis' to true.
 
		 add_axes(graphID, width, red, green, blue, side axis);
 
	 A regular grid can also be added. Specify the spacing between grid lines on 
	 both axis, the width (in [0,1]) and color. The grid can either start from 
	 the left and bottom side of the graph, or be centered on the (0,0) point by
	 setting 'zero align' to true.
 
		 add_grid(graphID, step x, step y, width, red, green, blue, zero align);
	
	 You can plot continuous curves by specifying lists of X and Y coordinates, 
	 along with the width ([0,1]) and color of the lines. Points clouds can be 
	 added in a similar manner, by specifying X and Y coordinates, a point size 
	 and color. Finally you can also add histograms, by specifying a set of 
	 values and a number of bins ; spacing between bars and their color should 
	 also be specified.
	
		 add_curve(graphID, x values, y values, line width, red, green, blue);
		 add_points(graphID, x values, y values, point size, red, green, blue);
		 add_hist(graphID, number of bins, values, spacing, red, green, blue);
 
	 These three functions return integers IDs that can then be used to update a
	 given plot on a given graph at a later time by calling respectively:
 
		 update_points(graphID, points cloud id, new x values, new y values);
		 update_curve(graphID, curve id, new x values, new y values);
		 update_hist(graphID, histogram id, new values);
 
	 All settings (width, size, bins, colors) are preserved. The IDs are managed
	 separately for each graph and each type of plot.
 
	 Call:
 
		 draw(graphID, screen ratio);
	
	 to draw a graph in the current viewport. If a screen ratio is specified, 
	 the graph will be rescaled to avoid any deformation ; else, nothing is done
	 to prevent deformations when resizing the window.

 Revision history
	 1.0 First public version! Support for curves, bar charts, points, axes with
		 arrows, grid, real-time updates.
	 1.1 Raylib conversion; c-compatible code
	 1.2 Godot conversion
