	<brief_description>
		Parent of all nodes that can be culled by the Portal system.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Provides common functionality to nodes that can be culled by the [Portal] system.
		[code]Static[/code] and [code]Dynamic[/code] objects are the most efficiently managed objects in the system, but there are some caveats. They are expected to be present initially when [Room]s are converted using the [RoomManager] [code]rooms_convert[/code] function, and their lifetime should be the same as the game level (i.e. present until you call [code]rooms_clear[/code] on the [RoomManager]. Although you shouldn't create / delete these objects during gameplay, you can manage their visibility with the standard [code]hide[/code] and [code]show[/code] commands.
		[code]Roaming[/code] objects on the other hand, require extra processing to keep track of which [Room] they are within. This enables them to be culled effectively, wherever they are.
		[code]Global[/code] objects are not culled by the portal system, and use view frustum culling only.
		Objects that are not [code]Static[/code] or [code]Dynamic[/code] can be freely created and deleted during the lifetime of the game level.

			When a manual bound has not been explicitly specified for a [Room], the convex hull bound will be estimated from the geometry of the objects within the room. This setting determines whether the geometry of an object is included in this estimate of the room bound.
