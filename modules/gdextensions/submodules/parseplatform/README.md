### Godot module (c++) for Parse Platform (https://parseplatform.org)

This is native module for Godot Engine - needs to be build together with the engine.

Please note, that:
* this is _work in progress_,
* this module might use some simple extensions/additions to _Godot Engine_ from my fork at: github.com/ppiecuch/godot,
* this module is part of my other projects, so development here happens periodically, when I need some _Parse_ features
* follow me on *https://twitter.com/ppiecuch* for latest development news and updates
